# My Ublock Origin Customisation

###### Note: Though this setting helps in preventing against ads, trackers and annoyances, this *MIGHT* increase your attack surface due to being fingerprinted.
###### To decrease the risk of fingerprinting, you can use *Mullvad Browser*, which comes with ublock origin in its default settings and is recommended to be used as is.

###### Ublock works better with Firefox based browsers. Chromium based browsers which still support MV2 (like Brave) can also be equally good. But its better to switch to firefox based browsers for better support in the future.

#### Pros
